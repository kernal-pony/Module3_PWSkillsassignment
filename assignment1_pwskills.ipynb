    "1.It is a cross-platform language.It can run on Linux, macOS, and Windows. For example, you can run the Python code for Windows in Linux or macOS, too.\n",

    "2.It offers various modules like operators, mathematical functions, libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Tensorflow, etc., and packages paving the way for the developers to save time to avoid re-writing the codes from scratch. To provide more functionality and packages, they also provide Python Package Index.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.It is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Unlike machine language like C, C++, It is a human-readable language. In other words, even a layman can understand the programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.It is easy to understand and easy to code, and anyone can learn Python within a few days. For example, a simple Python program to add two numbers is as follows:\n",

    "a = 8\n",
    "b = 9\n",

    "Line-by-line execution of source code, converted into byte code; thus, compiling the code is not necessary, making it easy to debug if required.\n",

    "8. Object-Oriented Programming Language\n",

    "9. Free and Open-source libraries\n",
    "It is a free open-source platform that can be downloaded easily from their Official Website.\n",

    "10. Support is provided for Graphical User Interface\n",
    "Lots of Graphical User Interface frameworks are available in Python, thus helping the software user, and it sticks to platform-specific technologies. It can be used in software development, web development, etc"
